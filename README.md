# About Me
Heyo! I'm LZulb. I mainly use Python as my main programming language and am trying to learn C# and GDScript.

The majority of my projects aren't posted here (though I'm working on that) because for many years I used Replit as my main portfolio.
I completely abandoned the platform after they ran their website to hell.

I wanna do more when it comes to game development because that's what I've had the most joy with recently.

You can find me almost everywhere with the handle: LZulb

I suppose a quick fun fact about me is that I have a pet rock that's been alive since ~2019
