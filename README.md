ðŸ‘‹ Heyo! I'm LZulb. I mainly use Python as my main programming language and am trying to learn C# and GDScript.

ðŸŽ™ The majority of my projects aren't posted here (though I'm working on that) because for many years I used Replit as my main portfolio.
   I completely abandoned the platform after they ran their website to hell.

ðŸ‘¾ I wanna do more when it comes to game development because that's what I've had the most joy with recently.

ðŸ’¬ You can find me almost everywhere with the handle: LZulb

ðŸ˜‰ I suppose a quick fun fact about me is that I have a pet rock that's been alive since ~2019. I suppose another one would be that my username is button-mashed.

# In The Future
ðŸŽ“ I'm going to go to college sometime in the future. ðŸŽµ don't know when, don't know where ðŸŽµ (yes, that's supposed to be a Gravity Falls reference... and it's true). 
    After that is said and done, I'm going to get a job as a software developer... but most likely start off with a silly IT job to log work hours within an IT job.
